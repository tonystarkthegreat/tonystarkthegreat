- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Laith Alsassa,
I am interested in bringing people together, becoming a great friend with programmers to build meaningful
, rich, enlightening, wise relationships, friendsships to bring significance and meaning while we code.
I am currently studying rocket science, machine learning, the power of the mind, spirituality.
I am looking for those who are looking for an extraordinary friendship to build with me to better the world together. I don't like to do things alone.
I am looking forward being a great friend of those who code the world of computers! See you on the other side!
